# Commute Time Influence On Home Prices

## Getting Started

Open the project and run the command below
```
jupyter notebook
```

There are two notebooks to run. The first one is `Collecting_Data_on_Commute_by_Metro_Area.ipynb`. This will collect all the housing data for the top 50 metro cities.

The second notebook to run is `House_Prices.ipynb`. Run this after the first one. This will collect the commute time data, and create a model to make predictions of home values based on commute time.
